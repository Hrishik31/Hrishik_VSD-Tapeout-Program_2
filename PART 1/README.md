## üéØ About This Project

This repository documents my journey through understanding fundamental concepts of **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design by exploring **VSDBabySoC** - a compact, educational RISC-V-based SoC that integrates three key components:

- **RVMYTH** - A RISC-V processor core  
- **PLL** - Phase-Locked Loop for clock generation  
- **DAC** - Digital-to-Analog Converter

## üîç Understanding System-on-Chip (SoC)

### What Exactly is an SoC?

Think of an SoC as a **complete computer system squeezed onto a single chip**. Instead of having separate components scattered across a circuit board, everything you need - the processor, memory, input/output interfaces, and specialized circuits - lives together on one piece of silicon.

#### Why does this matter?

- **Space efficiency**  
- **Power savings**  
- **Performance**  
- **Cost efficiency**  

### Key Components of a Typical SoC

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **CPU** | Executes instructions and coordinates operations |
| **Memory Subsystem** | RAM, ROM, Flash |
| **I/O Interfaces** | Bridges to external devices |
| **Specialized Processors** | GPU, DSP |
| **Power Management** | Voltage and power distribution |
| **Interconnect Fabric** | Highways for communication |

**Where Functional Modeling Fits?**

Functional modeling occurs early in the design flow, allowing designers to:

- ‚úÖ Validate concepts before detailed implementation
- ‚úÖ Detect architectural issues when they're easy to fix
- ‚úÖ Create reusable testbenches
- ‚úÖ Communicate designs to stakeholders
- ‚úÖ Explore trade-offs between approaches

**Tools Used:**
- **Icarus Verilog** - Open-source Verilog simulator
- **GTKWave** - Waveform viewer for signal visualization

## üöÄ How VSDBabySoC Works

### Signal Flow Story

1. **Power-On & Initialization**
   - External reset signal initializes RVMYTH
   - PLL receives reference clock and begins stabilization

2. **Clock Generation**
   - PLL locks onto reference frequency
   - Generates stable CLK signal for RVMYTH core

3. **Instruction Execution**
   - RVMYTH fetches instructions from internal memory
   - Processes data according to RISC-V instruction set
   - Updates register `r17` with computed values

4. **Digital-to-Analog Conversion**
   - DAC reads 10-bit value from `RV_TO_DAC[9:0]`
   - Converts to analog voltage level
   - Outputs signal for external analog devices

5. **Observable Outputs**
   - Digital signal: `RV_TO_DAC` bus
   - Analog signal: `DAC.OUT` (real datatype)

## ‚ö° Challenges in Mixed-Signal SoC Design

### 1. Simulation Limitations
- Analog behavior can't be perfectly represented in digital simulators
- Using `real` datatype as workaround (not synthesizable)

### 2. Timing Complexity
- Clock distribution across domains
- Setup and hold time violations
- Clock skew management

### 3. Integration Issues
- Creating proper interfaces between digital and analog blocks
- Generating LIB files for analog IP
- LEF file creation for physical design

### 4. Verification Challenges
- Gate-level simulation complexity
- LVS (Layout vs Schematic) matching
- DRC (Design Rule Check) violations

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Abstraction is Essential** - Start with high-level behavioral models before implementation
2. **Integration is Hard** - Careful attention to interfaces, timing, and signal integrity required
3. **Mixed-Signal is Different** - Requires understanding both digital and analog domains
4. **Tools Matter** - Open-source tools democratize access but may require more expertise
5. **Education Through Simplification** - Simple examples teach principles applicable to complex designs
