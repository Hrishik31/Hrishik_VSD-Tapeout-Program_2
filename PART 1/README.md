### PLL: The Clock Maestro

#### What is a Phase-Locked Loop?

A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase and frequency are synchronized with an input reference signal. It's the heartbeat of the SoC, ensuring all digital operations occur at precisely the right time.

#### Block Diagram and Components

![333810875-fd7730e9-a867-4ce3-bfc6-9453e3d8ad14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/217d602f-003d-4606-9bca-855a4832764c)<br>

#### Core Components Explained

**1. Phase Detector (PD)**
- **Function**: Compares input signal with feedback signal
- **Output**: Error signal proportional to phase difference
- **Types**: XOR, edge-triggered, or mixer-based
- **Role**: Measures how far the output is from desired frequency

**2. Loop Filter (LF)**
- **Function**: Processes the error signal
- **Type**: Usually a low-pass filter
- **Purpose**: 
  - Smooths the error signal
  - Removes high-frequency noise
  - Determines loop dynamics
- **Output**: Control voltage for VCO

**3. Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**
- **Function**: Generates output clock
- **Control**: Frequency varies with input voltage
- **Range**: Must cover desired frequency range
- **Output**: High-frequency clock signal

**4. Frequency Divider (Optional)**
- **Function**: Divides output frequency
- **Purpose**: Enables frequency multiplication
- **Example**: Divide by 8 means output is 8√ó input
- **In BabySoC**: Creates 8√ó reference frequency

#### How PLLs Work

**Lock Process:**

1. **Initial State**:
   - VCO runs at approximate frequency
   - Phase detector sees large error
   - Loop filter begins correction

2. **Acquisition**:
   - VCO frequency pulled toward target
   - Error signal decreases
   - System approaches lock

3. **Locked State**:
   - Output frequency matches target
   - Phase difference constant (or zero)
   - System maintains synchronization

4. **Tracking**:
   - Compensates for variations
   - Follows input frequency changes
   - Maintains lock despite noise

#### Why PLLs Are Essential in SoCs

**1. Clock Multiplication**
- Input: Slow external crystal (e.g., 10 MHz)
- Output: Fast system clock (e.g., 80 MHz for 8√ó PLL)
- Benefit: Don't need high-frequency crystals

**2. Clock Synchronization**
- Aligns clock edges across chip
- Compensates for distribution delays
- Ensures setup/hold times met

**3. Noise Filtering**
- Attenuates jitter on input
- Provides clean clock output
- Critical for high-speed operation

**4. Flexible Frequency Generation**
- One reference can generate multiple frequencies
- Different blocks can run at different speeds
- Programmable frequency ratios

#### Why External Clocks Aren't Always Sufficient

**1. Clock Distribution Delays**
- Long wires cause signal delays
- Clock arrives at different times to different blocks
- Can violate timing requirements
- PLL can regenerate clock locally

**2. Clock Jitter**
- External clocks have timing variation
- Jitter accumulates over distribution
- PLL filters and reduces jitter
- Critical for high-speed interfaces

**3. Multiple Frequency Requirements**
- CPU might need 100 MHz
- Peripheral might need 50 MHz
- Memory interface needs 200 MHz
- One PLL with dividers can provide all

**4. Crystal Frequency Limitations**
- Crystals available in limited frequencies
- High frequencies are expensive
- Temperature sensitivity
- PLLs enable using standard crystals

**5. Frequency Error and Stability**
- **PPM (Parts Per Million)**: Measures crystal accuracy
  - 50 ppm = 50 Hz error per 1 MHz
  - Higher ppm = less accurate
- **Frequency Tolerance**: Initial manufacturing error
- **Frequency Stability**: Variation with temperature
- **Aging**: Frequency drift over years
- **Total Error**: Sum of all contributions

**Example Calculation:**
```
Crystal: 10 MHz, 50 ppm total error
Maximum error = 10,000,000 Hz √ó 50/1,000,000 = 500 Hz
Frequency range = 10 MHz ¬± 500 Hz
```

For precision applications, this error is unacceptable. PLLs can lock to the average frequency and provide more stable output.

#### The 8√ó PLL in BabySoC

**Specifications:**
- **Input**: Reference clock (e.g., 10 MHz)
- **Output**: 8√ó multiplied clock (e.g., 80 MHz)
- **Purpose**: Provide fast clock for RVMYTH
- **Stability**: Maintains phase lock

**Benefits for BabySoC:**
- Allows slow, stable reference clock
- Generates fast processor clock
- Reduces external component requirements
- Demonstrates PLL integration

A **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** is the interface between the digital world of processors and the analog world we live in. It takes binary numbers and converts them into continuous voltage or current levels.

#### The Need for DACs

**Digital World:**
- Processors work with discrete binary values
- Everything is 0s and 1s
- Fast, precise, easy to store and process

**Analog World:**
- Real-world signals are continuous
- Audio, video, sensor control
- Voltage and current based
- What humans interact with

**DAC's Role:**
- **Translation**: Binary ‚Üí Voltage
- **Bridge**: Digital system ‚Üí Analog device
- **Interface**: Processor ‚Üí Real world

#### 10-Bit DAC Specifications

**Resolution:**
- **Bit Width**: 10 bits
- **Levels**: 2^10 = 1024 distinct output levels
- **Digital Input Range**: 0 to 1023 (decimal)
- **Binary Range**: 0000000000 to 1111111111

**Voltage Mapping** (Example):
- Reference Voltage (Vref) = 3.3V
- LSB (Least Significant Bit) = 3.3V / 1024 ‚âà 3.22 mV
- Output = (Digital_Value / 1024) √ó Vref

**Examples:**
```
Input: 0000000000 (0)    ‚Üí Output: 0.000 V
Input: 0000000001 (1)    ‚Üí Output: 0.003 V
Input: 0100000000 (512)  ‚Üí Output: 1.650 V
Input: 1111111111 (1023) ‚Üí Output: 3.300 V
```

#### DAC Architectures

VSDBabySoC could use either of two common DAC types:

**1. Weighted Resistor DAC**

  ![binary_weighted_resistors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/344e4ffd-7509-41e7-ac42-21a553b3db11)

**How It Works:**
- Each bit controls a switch
- Resistors weighted by powers of 2
- Current from each bit is binary-weighted
- Currents sum at output

**Advantages:**
- Simple concept
- Fast switching
- Direct binary weighting

**Disadvantages:**
- Wide range of resistor values needed
- Hard to manufacture accurately
- Large resistors occupy chip area
- Not practical for high bit counts

**2. R-2R Ladder DAC**

 ![comb99 gif copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c15f424-1a94-4424-b019-a76c0ca0db43)

**How It Works:**
- Uses only two resistor values: R and 2R
- Each section divides voltage by 2
- Switches route current to output or ground
- Binary weighting achieved through division

**Advantages:**
- Only two resistor values needed
- Easier to manufacture accurately
- Better matching between resistors
- Scalable to higher bit counts
- Smaller chip area

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more complex routing
- More resistors total

**VSDBabySoC Implementation:**
The R-2R ladder is more commonly used in integrated circuits due to its manufacturability and accuracy, making it likely the choice for this educational SoC.

#### DAC Performance Parameters

**1. Resolution**
- Number of bits (10 in our case)
- Determines smallest voltage step
- More bits = finer control

**2. Accuracy**
- How close output is to ideal
- Affected by resistor matching
- Temperature sensitivity
- Reference voltage stability

**3. Settling Time**
- Time to reach final value
- Important for fast signals
- Determines maximum update rate

**4. Linearity**
- **INL (Integral Non-Linearity)**: Deviation from ideal transfer curve
- **DNL (Differential Non-Linearity)**: Step size variation
- Critical for signal quality

**5. Noise and Glitches**
- Switching transients
- Supply noise coupling
- Digital switching noise

#### Role in BabySoC

**1. System Output Interface**
- Receives data from RVMYTH's r17 register
- Converts to analog voltage
- Provides observable output

**2. Real-World Connection**
- Can drive external analog devices
- Demonstrates digital-analog interfacing
- Enables practical applications

**3. Educational Value**
- Shows mixed-signal integration
- Demonstrates conversion principles
- Teaches interface design

**4. Application Examples**

**Audio Output:**
```
RVMYTH generates: [512, 600, 700, 800, 900, ...]
DAC outputs:      [1.65V, 1.93V, 2.25V, 2.57V, 2.90V, ...]
Result:           Rising tone on speaker
```

**Control Signal:**
```
RVMYTH generates: [0, 256, 512, 768, 1023]
DAC outputs:      [0V, 0.82V, 1.65V, 2.47V, 3.30V]
Result:           Stepped voltage for motor control
```

**Video/Display:**
```
RVMYTH cycles through brightness levels
DAC outputs corresponding voltages
Result: Grayscale display patterns
```

#### Digital-to-Analog Conversion Formula

For a 10-bit DAC with reference voltage Vref:

```
Vout = (Digital_Input / 2^n) √ó Vref
     = (Digital_Input / 1024) √ó Vref

Where:
- Digital_Input = value from RVMYTH (0 to 1023)
- n = number of bits (10)
- Vref = reference voltage (typically 3.3V)
```

### Functional Modeling Stage

Since we're currently at the **Functional Modeling** stage with VSDBabySoC, let's explore this in depth.

#### What is Functional Modeling?

Functional modeling describes a system's **behavior** without specifying how it will be implemented in hardware. It's like writing a story about what the chip does, rather than blueprints of how it's built.

**Key Characteristics:**
- High-level abstraction
- Focus on functionality, not implementation
- Fast simulation
- Easy to understand and modify
- Language: C, C++, SystemC, Python, or high-level HDL

#### Functional Modeling for BabySoC

**Components to Model:**

**1. PLL Behavioral Model**
```verilog
// Simplified behavioral PLL
module pll_behavioral (
    input  wire ref_clk,
    output reg  clk_out
);
    // Model 8x multiplication
    always @(posedge ref_clk) begin
        repeat(8) begin
            #delay clk_out = ~clk_out;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

**2. RVMYTH Behavioral Model**
- Execute RISC-V instructions
- Update register file
- Output data from r17
- Respond to clock

**3. DAC Behavioral Model**
```verilog
module dac_behavioral (
    input  wire [9:0] digital_in,
    output real analog_out
);
    parameter VREF = 3.3;
    
    // Simple conversion
    assign analog_out = (digital_in * VREF) / 1024.0;
endmodule
```

#### Simulation Flow

```
1. Initialize all modules
2. Apply reset

4. RVMYTH begins execution
   - Fetch instruction
   - Decode
   - Execute
   - Update r17
5. DAC converts r17 value
6. Record outputs
7. Repeat for N cycles
```

#### Tools for Functional Simulation

## üíª How VSDBabySoC Works

Let's trace a complete operation cycle through the system.

### Power-On Sequence

**Step 0: System Reset**
```
Time: t=0
- Reset signal asserted (RST = 1)
- All registers cleared
- PLL starts initialization
- DAC output = 0V
```

**Step 1: PLL Lock**
```
Time: t=0 to t=lock_time
- PLL receives reference clock (e.g., 10 MHz)
- Begins lock process
- VCO adjusts frequency
- After lock: outputs stable 80 MHz (8√ó ref)
```

**Step 2: Processor Initialization**
```
Time: t=lock_time
- Reset released (RST = 0)
- RVMYTH starts execution
- PC (Program Counter) = 0
- Begins fetching instructions
```

### Execution Cycle

**Clock Cycle 1-5: Program Setup**
```assembly
ADDI x17, x0, 0      # r17 = 0
ADDI x18, x0, 1      # r18 = 1 (increment)
ADDI x19, x0, 1023   # r19 = 1023 (max)
```

**Clock Cycle 6-1029: Main Loop**
```assembly
loop:
    ADD  x17, x17, x18    # r17 = r17 + 1
    BLT  x17, x19, loop   # if r17 < 1023, repeat
```

**What Happens Each Cycle:**
```
Cycle N:
  1. PLL provides clock edge
  2. RVMYTH fetches instruction
  3. Instruction executed
  4. r17 updated (e.g., r17 = 512)
  5. r17 value appears on RV_TO_DAC bus
  6. DAC converts 512 ‚Üí 1.65V
  7. Analog output changes to 1.65V
```


**Practical Applications:**

**1. Audio Tone Generation**
```
Program generates sine wave values
DAC outputs corresponding voltages
Result: Audio tone on speaker
Frequency depends on update rate
```

**2. LED Brightness Control**
```
Vary DAC output from 0V to 3.3V
Control LED current
Create fading effects
Demonstrate PWM alternative
```

**3. Motor Speed Control**
```
Output voltage controls motor driver
Digital computation of speed profile
Smooth acceleration/deceleration
Closed-loop control possible
```

**4. Sensor Interface**
```
Generate reference voltages
Calibration signals
Test patterns
Comparison references
```
